## Funding

I work on open source software projects such as this one in my spare time, and
make them available free of charge under permissive licenses. If you like my
work and would like to support me, you might consider [sponsoring
me](https://github.com/sponsors/alexrp). Please only donate if you want to and
have the means to do so; I want to be very clear that all open source software I
write will always be available for free and you should not feel obligated to
donate or pay for it in any way.
